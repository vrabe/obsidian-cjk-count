# CJK Count

A word count Obsidian plugin that only counts Chinese, Japanese and Korean (CJK) characters in the status bar.

## Limitation

No translation currently. It only displays Chinese.

## Acknowledgments

The plugin uses [`cjk-regex`](https://github.com/ikatyang-collab/cjk-regex) to filter CJK characters.
